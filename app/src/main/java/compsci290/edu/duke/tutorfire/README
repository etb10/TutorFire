How we tested our app:
While developing our app, we tested new methods by using a lot of Log statements. For example,
to make sure that we could access the web service correctly, we would print the JSON response
received from the web server, as well as logging what happens when we parse this response.
For testing new functionality, such as the chat, we would run the app on our phones and make
sure the new feature works. For example, we tested the chat feature by having two phones run
the app and sending messages between the two.

Harrison wrote a JUnit test for the FreeTimesAdapter class, to verify that Time objects each
representing one hour slots can be converted into Time objects of longer periods of time
when possible.

Lin Lin wrote JUnit tests to test the JSONParser classes.
